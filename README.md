# PySVM

PySVM is a support vector machine (SVM) framework designed for efficient and fast training and testing of SVM models. The framework includes modules for core math operations, data processing, SVM model implementation, and utility functions.

## Overview

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are powerful supervised learning models used for classification and regression tasks. This framework provides a streamlined approach to build and evaluate SVM models efficiently.

## Features

- **Core Math Operations Module**: Contains basic mathematical operations required for SVM, such as dot product and vector operations.
- **Data Processing Module**: Handles data representation and manipulation required for SVM, including loading, normalizing, shuffling, and splitting data.
- **SVM Model Module**: Implements the SVM algorithm, including training, prediction, and loss calculation.
- **SVM Utilities Module**: Contains utility functions for saving/loading models, calculating accuracy, and logging metrics.

## Usage

1. **Clone Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/phantom-kali/PySVM.git
    ```

2. **Move to the Cloned Directory**:

    ```bash
    cd PySVM
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run Example Script**: Use the provided example script `main.py` to train and test an SVM model:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

5. **Customization**: Customize the framework according to your specific requirements by modifying the modules and scripts.
